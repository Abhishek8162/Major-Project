           <p><b>1. What are the minimum system requirements I need for online exams?</b></p>
           <p>
You will need a working webcam (preferably external) and microphone, and a stable internet connection. You should take your written examination on either a desktop computer or laptop – the exam system is compatible with both Apple and Windows operating systems and a variety of browsers will allow you to download the exam website.
</p> 
<p><b>2.  My internet connection at home is really poor. What other options do I have?</b></p>

<p>If your internet connection is not reliable enough to take an examination, you can see if your workplace has the facilities to take the examination there. If this is not possible, then we suggest contacting a friend or family member who has a stable internet connection to allow you to take the exam at their house. You will also need to ensure that they are able to provide a quiet environment where you will not be disturbed for the duration of your examination.
</p> 

<p><b>
3. I’m an overseas candidate. Will I have to take my examination at an unusual time?</b></p> 
<p>
Examinations will be held at the same time across the world in line with GMT so if you are based overseas then your examination will take place at the equivalent time. Examinations will generally be held between 8:30am and 6pm GMT. 
</p>

<p><b>4. I require a reasonable adjustment to my examination. Will I be granted additional time/colour overlays/frequent restroom breaks/larger font sizes?</b></p>  

<p>
Reasonable adjustments will be granted in line with the recommendations made in your supporting evidence. If you have been given additional time, then this will be included. Font sizes and colour backgrounds will be able to be changed within the exam system. 
</p>

<p><b>
5. Will I be able to go to the toilet, eat or drink during the examination?</b></p>
<p>
You will be able to bring a drink with you for all examinations; for written examinations you may also bring a non-disruptive snack. In written examinations you may take a toilet break but must notify the proctor and you will not be given additional time to make up for this. Any suspicious behaviour will be noted by the proctor and reviewed by the College Examinations team. 
</p>

<p><b>6. How will you stop candidates from cheating?</b></p>
<p>
The exam system will lock down the device that you are using so that the only thing you can access is your examination. The examinations are fully live-proctored via webcam and microphone, so the proctors will be able to pick up on anything they think is suspicious and directly communicate this to the candidate
</p>

<p><b>7. What is happening to any video footage of me? Is it being stored and if so, when will it be deleted?</b></p>
<p>
Video footage will be temporarily stored in line with GDPR. This is strictly for the purposes of reviewing candidate data to investigate any possible incidents that may take place during an examination. For oral examinations, video footage may also be used for moderation purposes. 
</p>

<p><b>8. What hens if I am late for the examination?</b></p>
<p>
For written examinations, if you are more than 30 minutes late you will not be able to sit. For oral examinations, you may be allowed in after the start of your exam, but extra time will not be added to compensate. In the case of technical difficulties, extra time will be added. You will be sent an e-mail with all the details for your examination timings and you must keep this e-mail safe
</p>

<p><b>9. Will there be an opportunity to provide feedback about the exam after I have taken it?</b></p>
<p>
In line with our normal practice, a survey will be sent to all candidates once all the examinations have taken place, for completion before results are issued, which will give you an opportunity to feedback on your examination experience.
